# etch-a-sketch

This is my submission for TheOdinProject's challenge of creating a simple etch-a-sketch pixelated sketchpad. Current functionality includes a default brush mode (light gray), a randomized brush mode, and a darken mode (darkens any colored pixel by 10% with each pass). As for now, there is no eraser to target specific pixels for clearing as well as click-only brush mode. Will consider adding in the future! :slightly_smiling_face:

Special thanks to TheOdinProject in supplementing my learning. [Visit their project page here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

Note: Darken functionality implemented with [pSBC.js](https://github.com/PimpTrizkit/PJs/wiki/12.-Shade,-Blend-and-Convert-a-Web-Color-(pSBC.js)).
